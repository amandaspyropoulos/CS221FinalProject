-1 Before you mess around on my work

-1 Bye!
Don't look, come or think of coming back! 

-1 All of my edits are good.  People like you who revert good edits because you don't understand how to write well, and then revert other edits just because you've decided to bear a playground grudge, are the problem.  Maybe one day you'll realise the damage you did to a noble project.  201.215.187.159

SORRY BUT NO ONE EVER SAID HE WAS NUMBER ONE!! But he is clearly listed as being ""second only to Batman"" and a ""master detective and martial artist"" and been trained in all the mentioned combat discplines.

Also, what your problem is your going by low end showings and not HIGH end showings where he's proven more than a match for a meta like Slade and pinned Shiva down in one of his earliest appearences.
