You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are ""unencyclopedic"", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than ""unencyclopedic"", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay."

Response to your recent edit at Loyola Academy
Having attended Loyola Academy, I think it's fair to say that the students come from Chicagoland. ""Northern Illinois"" is definitely misleading, as it suggests that students are commuting from places like Rockford and the Quad Cities.  They're not. (It's not a boarding school, or anything like that.) To my knowledge, there weren't even any kids from Naperville or Aurora. Chicagoland is sufficiently broad enough.  "

=== Dude, seriously - you need to relax a bit. Life isn’t all about research and fact hunting. You went crazy when you saw a hoax page, and did hours of research into it. It was a blatant hoax, and it WAS just a childish game, which you got involved in. I hope you’re happy that you spotted the hoax, but anyone could have done it. You even got your friend on the case to do research into it!

 I agree that Wikipedia has no place for rubbish, but it’s the administrator’s job to delete the rubbish. I think at the end of the day, you've got to have fun and researching about some fake person isn't the way to do it. I think to a degree everyone’s idea of fun is different, but almost everyone in this world will agree that what you did wasn't it. I’d prefer to play scrabble with Arabic letters than research into a prank, if you want a debate then I’ll be on my user page, I always enjoy having chats with you - that IS fun!

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of ""shame"" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on ""North Nicosia"" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an ""encyclopedic"" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

So his summaries weren't ""AS"" antagonistic.  So whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning.  Good to know.  On to your second claim: I still don't understand how *I* have a ""pattern of edit warring,"" but Olyeller doesn't when: (1) I added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence; and (2) OlYeller repeatedly removed it for NO VALID REASON; and (3) Olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page.  So it's odd that falsifying summaries isn't considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. The only reason OlYeller removed it is because he has a really big anti-Carbonator grudge. I once called him a ""thin-skinned prick"" and he took it badly.  He now confirms the validity of said appellation by obsessively searching for ANY of my edits and reverting them, which is exactly what he did in this case.  How is that not vandalism?   "

I saw it, and I removed it. I may have missed some information that was outside of my scope of knowledge on the subject, but I made the appropriate changes wherever I could.

 re: Shadowclan AfD 

Hey, just to let you know, when you're nominating an article for deletion that's already been through the deletion process before, like you did with Shadowclan, you have to create a separate AfD page for the nomination, not put it on the page of a previous nomination. I've already done this for you by moving the current nomination to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shadowclan (3nd nomination), but in the future you can create subsequent AFDs with either the afdx template or adding ""(Xth nomination)"" in with the article title in the normal AfD template.

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""clarification"") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   "

Perhaps the single most potent way to balance the article in line w/ Jimbo's comments would be to expand discussion of Guevara's admission that, during the Missile Crisis, had he and Castro controlled the missiles, they would have fired them onto American cities as soon as the blockade started. He would have regarded this as ""a beautiful death"", despite having killed tens of millions of innocent Americans, despite the annihilation of Cuba and probably despite a global nuclear holocaust killing billions and destroying civilization. I am hoping you will expand the two sentences currently dealing with this and that you will summarize the incident in the intro.  "

=== Alain, thank you for the quick reply. I dídn't understand what you mean - do you plan to make a bibliography for each translator (too much work!) or simply order a list of major works that have been attempted by numerous translators, which is the system I am following now? My list of works is rather loosely chronological, and unfortunately focuses heavily on English language translators (since they're the ones I know best.) If you know famous translators from other languages, you are welcome to add their names to the list or to the Talk page, from where I shall order and add them later.   05:07, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)

 Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's unhelpful. Cheers.   03:56, 30

I've re-added straight facts from well documented sources. It will be curious if you or any other editor gives a reason for reverting this, as it conforms to criticism I've received. There is nothing that can be construed as OR or editorialization.
Anyone can choose to take it to the Talk page. I see this is not the first time that editors have made efforts toward a balanced article.

=== Also, I see that you have experience with what it takes for film articles to be GA, so you may have already known about WP:PLOT and a bit of what I mentioned above in this section. Your editing to the Avatar (2009 film) article has been a little (just a little) to the contrary on these matters, though. 

I do not mean to sound as though I am condescending to you or anything of that nature. I know that you do great work here, and I appreciate that.

I can explain this. In 1948, Danish followed Norwegian in orthographic reforms. One of them was to change ""aa"" giving an [ʌ] sound, into the Nordic å. Before logging into Wikipedia, I changed this because I became aware of this. I'm not entirely sure in which context though, whether Jytte/Jutte's surname is affected by it. Sorry if I've caused a little confusion.

=== TFA - Dec 23rd 

Sorry to bother you on your talk page. A few users have requested that the newly minted feature article Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr. be used on December 23rd, the 200th anniversary of his birth - and worked hard to get it to feature status before that anniversary. Since the 23rd is less than one week away, I was wondering if you could make a decision whether you can swap it out for the current article slated to appear that day, Fauna of Australia. Thx in Adv.

This article was wonderfully amusing and interesting.  I look forward to seeing it utterly destroyed so that it will conform to Wikipedia's quality standards.

=== James....Are you suggesting that because I know someone that they are conflicted? I know thousands of people, so based upon your arbitrary definition you feel that you have the right to exclude information that I had nothing to do with? You have vandalized the site once again with information taken out of context and applied it to cast a negative light on the technology. Again I ask for your motivation?  Did you even ready the study to which you seem to want to promote?  Are you friends with the authors? I believe you have an ethics issue.   Does Wiki have a policy on bearing false witness?

=== For your information sir, feminism is merely the belief that women are equal to men. You've just stated that he does not care about the sex or race of individuals. He obviously disagrees with many feminists on certain issues, particularly abortion, but he believes men and women are equal, and thus, is a feminist. This article misquotes Limbaugh and makes it sound like he believes unattractive women should not have access to mainstream society. If you do not think he is a sexist, than why should this portion not be corrected?

That church may be ""barely notable"" to you, as you live in Canada, but it is very notable to members of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, as it is the oldest Catholic church in one of the five boroughs of New York City. Who are you to be the artbiter of such matters? Unlike you, I live in Staten Island, so I think that makes me a little more qualified than you are to comment on places in Staten Island.

=== "::::""The Rapture: Hoax or Hype?""  That's about as big a violation of NPOV as one can get.  That is certainly a useful guide... of what to avoid.  We've covered all the POVs here, including the fact that Amillenialists and Post-Millenialists are less likely to use the term than Historic Premillenialists, even though their formulation of the doctrine with the Second Coming is virtually identical.  That's about as good as we can do here.  But ""hoax or hype"" writing isn't something Wikipedia is meant to do.

=== Release date is wrong in the chart, also 4GB model missing 

The chart showing each version of the iPhone and the release dates fails to mention the 4GB, also it says they were released on sept5, 2007, when in fact they came out june5, 2007 (as the article says in other places).  I'd edit it, but I don't have an account.

=== They're describe themselves as conservatives not far-rightists. You can't take one source (a newspaper? We all know that newspapers all have liberal agendas) and describe them as such (although I do sincerely believe they are a fascists). Bottomline is, they should be described as they describe themselves, not as ONE newspaper does. A journalist is just one man with one opinion.

Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts? You know if we wrote that The Urantia Book is an epochal revelation containing religio-scientific cosmology... there would then start more POV debating.  00:34, 16

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the ""dynasty"" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs 

FAR
I've nominated the article for Featured Article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere.   

 Protection  

This article is starting to get vandilized again. If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected. I wonder why vandilism is returning to it. Get over it people, the superbowl's over!!!  
So you want me to request semi-protection?  communicator/kills'' 

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: ""Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, ""The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word ""howev

=== Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff. MediaWiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $1500. I’ll take the poor documentation associated with open-source software any day.

 Maybe irrelevant wasn't the ideal word choice. I wouldn't remove a photo of a Boston-located school from the Boston page, but I'd be a bit skeptical of its inclusion. It's just that there are something like 50 schools in the metroboston area. Even if you limit it to the more notable ones: MIT, Harvard, BC, BU, Berklee, Emerson, Suffolk, others I'm probably forgetting, which one do you pick? You can't put an image for every campus into that section, so which one is sufficiently representative? Also, I get the impression there's a minor status war between BC or BU (and probably other schools) regarding which one is depicted as the ""best"" school on wikipedia, so I think edits like the BC photo addition that could potentially be construed as marketing should be closely scrutinized. What do you think?  "

=== I refer to people's constantly taking the words of Jimbo as policy, the idea of removing any userbox with a political point of view is his point of view.  That's at the core of this problem, you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox?  Rather, there is Jimbo saying there shouldn't be any.  I completely understand that he started this, but he is not owner of it, a foundation was set up, perhaps you've heard of it - the Wikimedia Foundation.  I didn't say you had that same point of view, I'm saying that I was just telling the people who do to fuck off.  I made no attack on any editor, that you perceive it as such is truly sad, but such is life.  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language.  If one does not want personal pages on a site, one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that they're being used.  People who overstep the proper bound of their position should die, that I have encountered multiple administrators so far doing so does lead to the desire to fuck off, but I'm not done here.

 Silent letters 

The O in ""opossum"" is spelled but not pronounced. It is a silent letter, just like the H in the word ""honest."" The articles ""a"" and ""an"" are correctly based on the first pronounced letter, not simply the first letter. 

So, you have the phrase ""an honest man"" not ""a honest man,"" even though H is a consonant. Likewise, the phrase should be ""a opossum"" not ""an opossum,"" again based on the first pronounced letter. 

Therefore, I will go through the Article changing ""an opossum"" to ""a opossum."" The O in ""opossum"" is no different from the H in ""honest.""   "

I enjoy lacrosse and I am interested in UNC lacrosse history and all the cool facts too. You guys have a lot of facts, achievements, names, tournaments and events ,etc. It has been stated already, but just make sure to really sort those things out into categories or sections to make the viewer more satisfied to what they are looking at and reading. It's more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in. You can separate the tournaments like ""ACCs"" and ""NCAAs"" and then list what happened or what awards were accepted. Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse. Otherwise, keep finding more stories and information about UNC lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together. In addition to that, don't forget to reference your sources at the bottom and after information you have found along with access dates and names, etc. Keep it up and it will all come together great I'm sure. UNC LAX Get 'er Done."

I was typing the response when you visited the talk page.  It is the nature of Wikipedia to make a choose between users and so my comments were eliminated.  What I basically stated is that the material probably should NOT be in the article, the reasoning against her nomination needs to presented in a balanced NPOV manner.  Having its own section with each point starred is not NPOV.  Also, there must an attempt to provide the reasons FOR her nomination also, that was not present.  Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so ""bad.""  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.  So go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against JRB, but provide the arguments and thinking FOR JRB also.  And conclusionary statments just don't cut it.  Your contracts professor wants to hear 'why' the contract is void, he/she does not just want to hear you say the contract is void. Best, "

=== "Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ""the history of science"" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR

You're funny cat Iron Duke. I'm not stoking anything. The embers were still burning as you were the last one to comment here less than two hours before I made my comment above. That RomaC exercised restraint by allowing you to have the last word is a credit to her, to be sure. 
I commmented here to let RomaC know that Wehwalt made the pledge not to be involved in I-P article enforcement in his RfA. I didn't extort it from him. He might have chosen not to make it and take his chances and see how he fared. As it is, he volunteered to make that pledge. I view it as binding. If I ever see him take admin action in the I-P arena, I will consider a breach of that pledge, and will suggest that his admin tools be withdrawn from him for falsely advertising himself in the nom.

You have communicated about this matter on my Talk page, rather than on the article's, where this discussion belongs. Before you take it thereif you wish to do soplease be aware that you are using the term ""weasel word"" improperly. I see that this has been brought to your attention before and that, nonetheless, your misue of the term continues. And again, to repeat myself from the edit summary, your ""correction""""Despite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to this 'unexplained postmodern puzzle' (as dubbed by one scholar) have been proposed""is grammatically improper. It also demonstrates a tin ear. Your contributions may be in good faith, but they are hardly ""positive."" That is the reason they are being reverted, and no other.   "

Hi Jay.  The source that you've used (the strategy written by McCaffrey) is okay, but it would be very good if you would also mention some third-party source that discusses or describes the strategy. In the lingo of Wikipedia, I think the strategy itself is called a primary source, but Wikipedia generally prefers secondary sources.  I can look for secondary sources for this if you'd like.  Also, perhaps a bit more concise?  For example, I don't think it's really significant that McCaffrey ""recognized that illegal drugs remain widely available"", which is common knowledge.  Cheers.  "

Could you please fix the incorrect move  made. I don't have a problem with the actual move, but he did it by cut-and-paste rather than using the move feature. Thanks,  18:30, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)

=== I don't mean to intrude, but I have noticed the same, W.  There is a solution, but it's the baddest of bad words, on Wikipedia: deadlines.  The vast majority of words written by journalists and academicians weren't written because they wanted to.  Version 1.0 is moving along, and the Germans are almost ready to issue their printed, 50K-article, 1000-printed page Bertelsmann (Random House) encyclopedia, having been hard at work on the printed version since 2004.  Not getting a core of publishable articles on Wikipedia is simply not an option; it will be printed in some form or another, and as soon as it looks like someone else is beating us to it in this new wiki-world we've created, my guess is we'll get something out the door, if we have to hire content experts or translate the German printed encyclopedia to do it.  Every wikiproject should be thinking about these things. - Dan  (mistakes)

Estadunidense

What you should realize is that these two users are Brazilian leftists, trying to defend the spread this word via Wikipedia. Wiki-PT have a large influx of communists, socialists and left-lists using your structure for spreading ideological ideas (articles of politics at Wiki-PT are a disgrace, totally advocate a political vision and always attack the other), and of course, they come here as well. Any Brazilian acquainted in politics (few people) know that the word ""Estadunidense"" is used only for fanatics anti-US or ignorant who do not know the political meaning of this word, and just talk because they read somewhere. You will not find this word in any common and serious Brazilian media, only radical blogs and a few media organizations that have strong links with the left.   "

=== You recent addition to Super Bowl XL 

For your information: I removed the following addition you made to this article:

In a recent interview with the NFL Network, a referee from Super Bowl XL has defended many of the calls made by the officials. He went through them and has explained why the NFL believes that the correct calls were made. However, he does believe that the low block on Matt Hasselbeck was a mistake.

The problem is that you cite a link to a blatantly copyvio'ed video of Pereira's entire segment that was recorded in its entirety and converted to a WMV file. Personal websites as secondary sources are not acceptable. See Wikipedia:Reliable sources for more information. Thanks.  (Talk)

Wiesehofer does not know ancient Akkadian and has never been cited for translating ancient Akkadian text.  He is a Professor of Iranian studies mainly Sassanid era.  He is not a professor of semitic studies.  Also Lambert does not use the term ""widely"".  We are arguing about the ""accepted"" part.  Also the agreement was to list the four translations in terms of chronological order.  There seems to be a POV push here where-as I am just trying to list the four translations in terms of chronological order.  ChrisO has no proof that Wiesehofer has given an independent translation.  I know Wiesehofer's academic background well enough and he has articles mainly on Sassanid and Parthian Iran.  He is not a scholar of Akkadian or for that matter has published anything with regards to Akkadian translations.  There seems to be a gross violation of POV.  I am just listing 4 translations which is the NPOV thing to do and the reader can judge.Nepaheshgar "

Being completely free of the type of data that you tried to delete previously, you now have the freedom to design your reconstruction of the masm page so that it accurately reflects your understanding of the notability of the Microsoft Assembler and would wish both of you the best of luck in learning the minimum to actually say something coherant about the subject.

=== Oh you can bet your marathon medal that I will have it recreated. Again and again. Either I will or somebody else will when the new film starts production. I'll keep you busy for an eternity. You're talking nonsense. I dont need any of those things to verify Mr. Hunter's films. IMDB employs a vigorous verifying process. I urge you to buy copies of Mr. Hunter's films and watch them yourself. That should be good enough. The films are within the public market. They are for sale on Amazon.com, and they have been submitted to half a dozen film festivals. The article has been cleaned up why is that not good enough for you?  (talk20 December 2008

 ""The Journal of the Society for Psychical Research has been published continuously since 1884,  promoting the Society's aim of examining ""without prejudice or prepossession and in a scientific spirit those faculties of man, real or supposed, which appear to be inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis. The Journal's contents reflect the wide range of our contributors' specialisms and interests and include reports of current laboratory and fieldwork research, as well as theoretical, methodological and historical papers with a bearing on the field of parapsychology.""  

Quoted from the SPR website:  ""All papers submitted to the Journal are strictly peer-reviewed"".  So your accusation is not based on any facts Goblin Face.  Obviously the IP address you cite is different from this ""jamenta"" IP address, so again, you are coming up with a very spurious and inauthentic accusation here.

=== I noticed at the time that Tango reinserted the material you blocked me for adding to Giles Hattersley, but didn't think anything more of it, distracted as I was dealing with my own blocking. Now I've just seen elsewhere that you blocked him aswell. Subsequently reading the opinions at his talk page where he is unblocked after one hour, especially from other admins over what constitutes a personal attack, I am less than happy at how I got shafted over this incident, in which you have still failed to show I was intentionally attacking Giano - you seem to have absolutely no shame in levelling the same theory at Tango, an editor registered since Dec 2002, that you did to me, that the simple fact we are experienced editors that would have never seen a user's name linked in an article (I am still entirely unconvinced this is even true, especially for Wikipedia related text, but I have not researched it), we 'just should have known' it was considered a personal attack, blockable after no warning after making one edit/revert. Like I said, I would be willing to take it as 'ignorance is no defence' if this appeared in any policy text that I had just missed. And judging by his unblock request, he was not mistaken about what he was re-adding. So, quite clearly, you are attributing some malicious motive to me, that you aren't to Tango. Had I known of that discussion at the time, I have a good idea that things might have gone differently for me. It's not like I can do sod all about it now.

=== "Because I'm a pedant like this: In response to the last paraphrase, from 101 - 102 of Asbury's The Great Illusion, I'm tempted to call npov here. Asbury states that neither Pussyfoot nor his associates were ""punished or even reprimanded;"" further, he even states that they were ""justified."" However, there's a distinct difference between whether something is moral or justified. Anyway, I'm nitpicking. Here's the passage so you can judge for yourself:
""Although Pussyfoot Johnson's political operations failed by a large margin to conform strictly to the Christian principles upon which the league had been founded, neither he nor others who employed similar 'variations' were ever punished or even reprimanded. It was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the Lord's business, anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the Almighty.""

 Private press 

Our article private press and this one suggest to me that ""private press"" may be a book collecting term for fine press.

Is there a business difference?

Should the articles be merged?   "

I was a little disheartened by your participation  here. As a result of your comments made at the AE request, I feel the need to ask you a question or two. I'd like to do so here on your talk page, but I thought I'd ask your permission first. You might be busy with other things or prefer not to bother yourself with this request. Up to you. Thanks.

 Another AfD stats example 

I hope you don't mind me letting you know about these examples. I don't know if there's anything you can do to refine how the tool works, but I just thought it would be good for you to know certain examples on it. In regards to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deathlands, the tool closed it as Merge, presumably because it pulled out the word merge from the closing statement. However, the close is really more of an N/A, or a no consensus if you require specific terminology, since the result was that there couldn't be any real outcome for such a huge joint nomination of articles. serenC "

=== Hello, FKC. I don't know of any WP Books guidelines about how the caption for an image in an infobox should be written. Sounds like the kind of thing you should bring up over in the project and see what people say, particularly if you're thinking that the decision should apply to all articles in the project. It's not something I'd want to decide unilaterally.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users ""dumb fucks"". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They ""trust me""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

In another instant message (IM)

FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?

ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them

ZUCK: probably in the year

ZUCK: *ear

 LARS IS FANTASTIC 

Somebody allowed this on Wikipenis. -  I'm wondering who did it? ahahhaahah! Look, stop being so possessive about the el caminos.  The more you try to censor me, the more fun I have making you relive my accomplishments. Also, why did you send me that autographed framed poster of raised by wolves? would you like it back? it must have been yours (its in my closet collecting dust.) Finally, why does the el camino fan page need 40,000 photos? Are they supposed to showcase which fan took a shit with an el camino during some played out, washed up, tired gig? it makes no sense - I have plenty of quality videos that could be used to promote the el caminos, but you guys would rather  post another photo of a drunk fan who took a shit with an el camino. Look, I'll handle the El Camino Box Set, you guys keep doing what you're doing. ahahha!

Cleanest City - It is surprising that Trivandrum is 73 out of 250. But, that surely is not a good ranking. Like Aarem suggested, being in the Top 10 deserves to be called 'one of the cleanest'. Also, cleanliness is not just about 'clean', it is about pollution, waste treatment etc. I suggest that 'one of the cleanest' should be removed.
Best Airport- I am not sure what this means. This tag was given well before the new Terminal was inaugurated. I cannot understand how one could rate the old TRV terminals as one of the best! If looks is the yardstick here,most of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals. Also, the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport - in terms of - revenue, traffic, profits, passenger traffic, facilities? If you would like to retain it, please be more specific and of course have the references ready.
Cheapest and Closest option - I would suggest rephrasing this to ""one of the closest options to Maldives and Sri Lanka and the only direct option to Maldives. You can always use a connecting flight is what I am trying to say. For instance, someone in the UAE can fly to Colombo and catch a flight from there to MV. - MountainWhiskey  "

=== First off, I am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. I don't know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. As a life long resident of Miller, having both parents from Miller I am well aware of the boundaries of Miller. and your account is false...
Also, I am not talking of this ORIGINAL TOWN of Miller or is supposed boundaries but The Miller Beach Area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call Miller Beach a Neighborhood of Gary makes the very notion of Miller smaller than it really is... I don't have agenda here. I just don't want my home town slighted by mis-information. It is the word Neighborhood that is of issue. Miller Beach has several Neighborhoods... It was settled almost 100 years before Gary was established. It is town that has been annexed. It is not a neighborhood of Gary. It existed before Gary. These are historical facts. Is Miller under the municipal control of the City of Gary? YES...Is it an area within the political boundaries of Gary, Yes... is it part of Gary? No

=== Senior descendant of Victoria & Albert? 

Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.

=== Hello Cindamuse,

1. Please review/edit the page http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle_Recruiter 
2. It is true indeed, I represent the company that makes the software described on this page. Please advice on the possible references/ sources I can quote to improve the authenticity/neutrality of the content. 
3. I do not have too many edits. My username violates the wiki-policy as I note now, since it contains the name of the company I represent - 'Bredge'. Please advice on what happens to the already created page if I create a new account. 
4. You have renamed 'History' to 'Corporate History'. May I request a reconsideration? The content talks only about the history of the product. 
Thanks much! 
Varun.

My impression remainst that the only reason this article is so long and detailed is the attempt to disguise from the casual reader the fact that the entire thing can be shrugged off in a one-liner.

Yes, that's probably true, but what is the alternative?  Many of us have been battling to make the CMT clear, but every time a statement is made on how crazy the theory is, the other side asks for a proof/citation.  And since that has happened almost every week for the last six months (and probably longer), the article has grown in size.  I'm not sure how we can overcome this problem, but I'm open to suggestions.

I'd say that this is a good statement for unblocking.

I'll try and figure out the autoblock, too.— (竜龍) 20:09"

=== Adding the Nazi party to Infobox politician under the heading Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, which makes it look like he represented the Nazi party as Minister-President, may easily be interpreted as vandalism. The Nazi party does not belong to the infobox for very obvious reasons stated at the article talk page.

=== As noted on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Helicopter use in Brasil, the newspaper article which has been cited as the source of this claim doesn't actually support it, and probably isn't a very good source to cite anyway. So I'd recommend removing this claim unless there is better verification available. Otherwise we will find ourselves cited as the source and it will become an urban legend. 

If you want to preserve the claim and encourage other editors to work on it, put it in the talk page (here), or just link to it in the article's history from the talk page. Then, if it can be verified, that's the time to put it into the article.

=== Once again, you don't know what you are talking about! There are only two primary sources for Ambrosius, and they are Gildas (the main source) and Pseudo-Nennius (who makes use of Gildas, plus adds in some snippets of chronicle material and folklore), both of which are cited in the previous version of the article, along with secondary sources such as Bede and Geoffrey and reliable, modern scholarly sources (Chadwick, Woolf, Gidlow, and Fleuriot are all respectable scholars). You need to leave this article alone if you unclear about the sources.

While this may sound strange coming from an anonymous user, I'm quite shocked that this article is not semi-protected.  Mao Zedong was (and still is) a VERY controversial figure, to say the least.  He ranks up there with Hitler and Stalin, and this page is vandalized just as much as those pages are.24.129.100.84

Hello Masterpiece2000!

Yes he has an arts degree!

You sad something I wanted to here from someone since long ago. He deserves to have an FA, and even one of the best FAs. I would also like to expand it; it is almost empty compared to his great achievements and accomplishments. We need to try and start writing his illustrious, but the biggest concern is finding reliable sources, from newspapers and books.

=== Well, it is better but you didn't have consensus. I'm doped on morphine so I will leave it for now, safe in the knowledge that the clued-up will eventually get their point proven.

The removed paragraph 
Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic

I have removed this paragraph, not because I would necessarily disagree, but because this is a speculative formulation (a ""POV"" in wikipedia terminology) not suitable for an encyclopaedia. If this was an undisputed topic, maybe such formulations could work, but since that is not the case, it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data.  "

=== Freedom of Speech

The issue is not freedom of speech, which I uphold proudly, but child abuse. I have made it very clear that defending child abuse is not defending freedom of speech - to say it is is verging on nihilistic. It really seems that most editors here have a very naieve view on what constitutes freedom of speech.

 Response to third opinion request:Hi, I'm here to give your third opinion.  I think it's important to keep in mind that this article is titled ""Common English usage misconceptions"".  It's not ""Common English mistakes according to professional typography standards"".  It is clear - to me at least - that the hypen is often misused.  There's no dash key on my keyboard.  I know how to make a dash, however, —.  But I do web dev and work for a printing company. And I just started a sentence with ""but"", and this one with ""and"".  I know all these things are wrong - but they are convenient - and I'm writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page.  So, in my mind, the question is whether this is a misconception, or just ignorance.  I believe that to properly call something a misconception, it must be believed to be a rule, when in fact such a rule is not correct.  I've never heard anyone say, ""just use hyphens for everything"".  It has only become the default, because we have no dash keys.  So I would lean toward excluding this entry, unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes, not just misconceptions.  Hope this helps.   "

I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, ""In Cold Blood"", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.

Hey, nice work on the image. I would update the image myself, but I don't know how so here is what found missing on your image (based on the maps at this link  ):
- Lugoj-Sibiu on A1
- Ploiesti-Focsani on A5
- Cluj South Motorway
- Bucharest Ring Motorway
Also, I did not find any reference about the Focsani-Bacau sector that you labeled as planned.
Cheers!

=== Improper usage of this talk page! 

Ok, I know I shouldn't use talk pages like this. However, my mini schnauzer is 6 now and starting to be a little bit old (not quite as active as she used to be). Is all the diabetes etc stuff true? What are the warniing signs?

=== "::::This ""poll,"" while doubtless entertaining to BBC audience in England, and perhaps of some interest, is not a conventional poll, and certainly no reputable polling organization would offer such results as a scientific measure of pubic sentiment

Further, it's presented as if it reflects a historical trend in public opinion  as if according to a scientific measurement, Scott's popularity had declined over a period of time. However, there are no comparable measures from previous years presented (presumably because there aren't any).

Had the BBC conducted a similar call-in program in 1955, '65, etc., perhaps Scott would have been more popular in earlier years. I bet in earlier years, he would have ranked much higher than Boy George, et alia, than during early 21 Century broadcast ""poll"".....

Am I at least partly stating a semi-plausible case for why this may be non-useful information?

=== The romanization of Thai names is a pain, there are lots of different schemes, and even though there is one official scheme (which has many weaknesses, see Royal Thai General System of Transcription) by far not all texts from government follow it - especially on websites. There is a list of recommended spellings, yet I somehow cannot find the link right now, but at least for the letters I think I have followed that list. I don't know by which rule the buri (which means town) is spelled with blank or without, it's confusing me as well. As soon as I find that list again I will check again if I did all spelling correctly...  19:27, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

As for your removal of my post on the talk page, you should read up on WP:TPO.  Specifically:
The basic rule—with some specific exceptions outlined below—is that you should not edit or delete the comments of other editors without their permission.

Are we getting a bit informal?
In the sentence here: ""In the first quarter of 2008 Ian Kerr left his position as CEO, to be replaced by Bert Pijls. Egg is managed under the blanket of Citi EMEA. Which essentially means that Bert controls all Citi operations within Europe, the Middle East and Asia when formulating strategy.""  Using 'Bert' seems a little too informal, presuming it is his first name. Any thoughts?"

=== I'm not incorrect. Labor cost is labor itself. The cost of building anything is the labor itself that you exerted to build it. If you charge more labor for something that took less labor to build, then you're not being equitable according to Warren. It's very simple and straightforward.

=== EXPERT OVERHAUL DESPERATELY NEEDED! 

Expert overhaul of this really quite poorly written article is desperately needed. 

The neutrino will for several months if not years be the focus  of one of the highest-stakes scientific investingations of all time. It follows that Wiki's article on the topic should be rigorously accurate, coherent and up to date, and copiously detailed. Such standards cannot be met by the usual edit crowd of nattering amateurs.

Let us try to obtain the services of both experimental and theoretical professional working physicists, and give them editing freedom and protection to provide for site needs.

=== Merger proposal 
I propose that List of Deans of ILR School be merged into Cornell University ILR School. I think that the list could easily be just a table in the history section of this article, and theschool article is of a reasonable size in which the merging of list of deans will not cause any problems as far as article size or undue weight is concerned.

SandyGeorgia, with respect to the Catholic Church article and the good faith editors who respectfully disagree with Karanacs positions, you really have too much to say - you are not even engaged in the article and barely know what is happening as revealed in your rejected Arbcom complaint. Your persistent harrassment of me and Xandar is bordering on Bullying. Please stop cradling Karanacs and defending her behaviour because a true friend helps their friend be a better person, not hide their faults. All I have ever done with Karanacs is tell her when she has twice crossed the line. That dispute is between Karanacs and myself - it is none of your business. As for the CC FAC, one of the reasons why I think its progress has been stalled is because of Karanacs and that is why I complained to her.   '''talk "

=== So this argument you're employing is something you support that is hardly a credible source compared to FAS, Globalsecurity, Finance Yahoo, CNBC, the likes.  But you're giving more validity to 1 person.  It's like an argument we should support the HUMINT that people claims that the Pentagon admits that WP is a chemical weapon.  Valid Sources matter.  Not a site that a person agrees with.  This is not yours or  as you're trying to make it.

Image Tagging Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ""my contributions"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ""Image"" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Image legality questions page. Thank you. —@ "

 Changing use of nickname to proper article title in various pages 
On various football related pages, the word ""Socceroos"" is used, occasionally as a link word to this article, but occasionally simply the word itself with no links. I have changed these examples to using the wikipedia title, Australia national association football team. We don't go around calling the St. George Illawarra Dragons the ""Red V"", the Penrith Panthers the ""Chocolate Soldiers"", nor do we refer to the GWS project as ""AFL's Vietnam"" or the ""Canberra Giants"". There is no need to use a nickname. Have put this here just in case anyone feels they need to complain about my edits.   "

?? Most anarchists recognize the existence and differences between individualist anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists, collectivist anarchists, anarcho-capitalists, etc.  You are correct that most definitions use the word ""government,"" but you need to acknowledge that they mean ""state,"" and not simply voluntary governance.

To expand on one aspect of that: Wikipedia's three main content policies are:
WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: ""all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""
WP:No original research: ""The term ""original research"" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""
The last two mean that content based on your ""extensive participation in two of the three events (making me VERY knowledgeable of what occurred both in public and private, with a bare minimum of conjecture)"" is not acceptable as a basis for additions to the article. 

I hope your question is adequately answered, so I have ""turned off"" the ""helpme"" - please add another if you need more advice. Regards,   "

First of all, let's use proper English.  There is ""Turkic"" as adjective and there is ""Turkic people"" as noun in modern English. There is no ""Turkics"" in English as a noun.  Azerbaijanis by far is the rightest terminology.  If you want to emphesize the ancient periods, Azerbaijani still should be fine, because ""Azerbaijani"" is a new term for Turks who used to live in old days.  Only Azeris have lived in or near modern Armenia.  Kars, Igdir which are in Armenian border of Turkey are all populated and used to be populated by ethnic Azeris (and then some Kurds).  There is no known fact of Anatolian Turks living in or near modern Armenia.    "

=== 24 X 7 Water Supply By Using Existing Resources

24 x 7 water supply is possible by using existing resources. The small supply of water in the bore wells can be used effectively. The existing pumps can be used with one regulator to adjust the capacity of pump/speed as per the supply of water in the bore wells which will maintain the continuity of flow; thereby the main principle of getting maximum water from the bore can be achieved i. e. Q outlet ≤ Q inlet. All the bore wells which are not in use because of its small supply of water will also start to function as per their capacities of inlet discharge.

=== Thank you all, we'll all improve the Wikipedia in 2007
Dear all! Thanks for the warm wishes and all the emails that came in while I was at the New Year's vacation.

Now that I checked back for what has been going on in the last ten days while I was away the situation seems hopeful indeed. The bunch of scandalous action inspired by the secretive plottings are still being discusses and widely condemned and I see I see a strong momentum of the community of the Wikipedia editors to finally put a decisive end to the secretive activity at the closed channels followed by the drastically insulting onwiki actions. I am also hopeful that the new arbcom will act on the recent developments.  

Happy New 2007 to all!

=== Actually, what we were referring to as the lead, is the lead statement for the History section. Sitush has himself mentioned here that Andre Wink is reliable, and we both had reached consensus on Tej Ram Sharma's statements in our earlier discussions. Now, in his absence, if you have any valid reason to remove reliably sourced content, you are welcome to discuss. In fact, I have great faith on you as a logical and neutral editor. Please note that Sitush could not come up with any counter opinion, as evident from the above discussions. It would be great if Sitush joins back the discussions. But since he has not left any message, therefore we have to move on. Please go through the sources cited, and let me know, if you have any issues. Thanks.

=== @: I feel like I can't improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved (the person I said it to and  who did the block 18 hours after the conversation was over).  If as  said, that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive, then I think its fair for me to ask questions about it - to see where the situation went wrong. When I posted that message, and I still haven't heard from the block admin that its content was the issue, I thought I was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal (human to human) level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person, rather than having us both resort to the standard drawn-out wiki-procedures. So far, at least on-wiki, that editor has had no reaction to what I said, while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions. I just have to ask if its fair that I be punished so intensely for their reactions to what I said, especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions, and me only able to appeal on this page.

=== No, thats not correct. I am asking that another admin. editor or two, besides, or including you, be assigned this article, as you have said you are in to deep, and have taken sides obviously in your edits. You are personally involved with editing.  I have said that the article is being controlled by a cabal. I have shown how that is happening. I have listed a number of areas that are down right misleading or wrong in the article. The most recent being the whole beginning of this article, which starts the whole thing off with wrong information. I have given information on how that is so.  
Also by phrasing your question the way your did, as a double negative, it is wondered why you would give a negative response ? 
You are not addressing the facts I have brought up such as why the TTCD is a stand alone separate link, when it has its own special box already linked on the Techinc site. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Check what I had to say again. Please.  ( )

=== In other words, it is your beliefs that say Aziz is not a Christian.  It is your belief that the Bible defines what a Christian is, your belief that failure to follow the Bible makes someone not be a Christian, and your belief that Aziz did not attempt to follow the Bible.

Yep...I got it...coming lad/lass (thanks for calling me on itmy family is old len'apiwe just take this stuff for granted and get pissed that it has to be sanctified by somebody elsepeople who misquote the mis-quoters (like donehoo). i'm working on a book now. first in family to get the phd to finally have the street-cred to back it up. anyway, Schowanneck (white) writers have gotten this wrong for 200 years. ""Con"" means ""rock"" in most Eroni languages. ""Can"" means pole. Can'a'da, for example, means buried-pole-place or house or town. the can'a'da at con'esto'ga was south of itat present washington boro. north of it was con'e'wa'ga or rock-and-water-place. whites call this 'falls.' up north, can'ee'en'ka mean sharp stone place (flint)it's where the mohawks lived...ti'con'a'wa'ga means two-stone-and-water-place. anyway, the white sanctification will come from zeisbergerbut remember, nobody ever wrote the language of the people of conestoga down. they were southern eroni, breakaways from ononda'ga and onon'yot-ah'da...and that aint in no book written by a schwanneck! that's why i won't put it into wiki...because that part needs to be sanctified by my book after it goes through its white approval process...because lord knows, we can't know our own story! gahhh! hey, thanks for doing what you do."

 This is weird... 

Thanks for improving the article Ayaka Asai, which I created (together with Tomoyo Kurosawa and Moe Toyota) a few months ago. I noticed a very odd error though: her agency profile says that she had a role in the 2013 Pokémon theatrical short Pikachu and Its Eevee Friends as ""Glacia"" (Glaceon). As a Pokémon fan myself, I immediately noticed some discrepancies: this website and the movie credits give the voice actress for the said role as Akeno Watanabe (itself an article needing immediate attention). I'm confused (in fact, the said role was included in my edit that created the article, but as you can see with this edit, I removed it for the reasons I mentioned above). could the agency have made a mistake?  tccsdnew "

=== Present Laughter
Having played Garry in Present Laughter on stage, I can assure you that the actual script states he has just turned forty. I suspect the version you saw altered the script to accommodate the actual age of the actor - this is not unusual and I have been in plays myself where it has been done.

=== Where is Poland? 
There is no reference to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (I added a couple sentences) despite the fact that the events were of great relevance to the Poles and several battles were fought in the western part of the country. The province of Silesia was ethnically Polish with German and Czech minorities, lied directly between Poland and Saxony whose king was elected king of the Commonwealth. A commentary by a knowledgeable historian would help: the country could field armies of tens of thousands yet remained neutral when its main ally - Saxony was being destroyed, while Prussia grew on the backbone of the old Polish provinces to attain the status of a major power.

=== CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

Thanks for holding off. A single redirect tends to work properly; where we can run into trouble is with double redirects. (For example, after the move/restore earlier tonight, a few pages were redirecting from TNO to Nonstellar body to Planet. The redirect stops after one redirect, so instead of an infobox those articles just displayed a link.) It is better to determine the name, and then make the changes across the board so that we can be sure there are no problems. ''''''chatspy "

=== There are many inaccurate statements being posted here. Far too many, i don't have time to correct all of them. The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact. BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism. If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF (Unite against Freedom), who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. Is that democratic? You might not like someone elses political views but that doesn't give you a right to go out and attack them violently.

In fact one of the main things taught to us was that the medical model was a poor model for the care of mentally handicapped people, because the model is based on treatment, and mentally handicapped people cannot be cured. A model based on normalisation or social role valorization is more appropriate. How can such a vast collecion of disorders/abilities be a single medical condition? I don't mean to be contrary, and must admit to having left the profession some 14 years ago. 20:00, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== A simple article indicating its history will suffice:
UP Mindanao is the sixth and newest autonomous unit of the University of the Philippines System. Established on 20 February 1995 through Republic Act 7889, its mission is to bring to the people of Mindanao the UP standard of academic excellence and commitment to academic freedom, social responsibility and nationalism. Subsequently, the Board of Trustees of the U.P. System formally created U.P. Mindanao on 23 March 1995.

=== Hitler was innocent... 

There are several groups that want to rewrite history to make Germany the innocent player.  A particulary fine example of this nonsense is .
Some of this article reads a bit weasily, that Germany was on the back foot and had to attack.

I particularly note that the article stated that Hitler made a peace offer before the battle.  I changed this to
On 6 October, he may have made some type of peace offer to both Western Powers.  Any statement along these lines needs to be made very carefully, what were the offers, and what are the sources for the information.

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

=== The author of LotR clearly intended it to be a single book, and it was sold as one concurrently with the three-volume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible.  The utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books.  This is in stark contrast with Rowling's books, which have been published sequentially, separated by years in between them, and are considered by everyone (including the author and publisher) to be separate books entirely.  I agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one, and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page.  I hope we can put this matter to rest now.

=== The last game Andrés Guardado played for Mexico was on 16 August 2012, so i added that date (and it's 16 August 2012, not August 16, 2012), the last game he played for Valencia (also first) was today, 19 August, i added that, will add now a ref to storyline. The exclamation points were exaggerated yes, but not an insult.

The books of Maccabees and the Gospels refer to the land (and nation) as ""Israel"" throughout this period and the term is still used in Acts. The Hasmonean kingdom was certainly not called ""Judaea"" as this ia a Latinized name and the Hasmoneans are prior to the Roman period. Similarly as explained in the article it was only after Herod the Great that the Roman expanded the usage of their term ""Judaea"" to include more or less the entire region that Herod had ruled. Maccabees and the NT are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as Israel, for a modern academic publication secondary source, see for example ""King Herod: a persecuted persecutor  a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography"", by Aryeh Kasher & Eliezer Witztum, Walter de Gruyter, 2007 where Herod is clearly referred to as King of Israel and e.g. ""A survey of Israel's history"" by Leon James Wood & David O'Brien, Zondervan, 1986, which refers to the Hasmonean ruling over ""Israel"" or say ""The Holocaust: roots, history, and aftermath"", David Crowe, Westview Press, 2008 which similarly speaks of Hasmonean ""Israel"".

=== Main Page balance 

Regarding this edit, are you certain that removing it improves main page balance, even after the latest DYK update   which is slightly longer than the one preceding it? It doesn't seem that way to me, having checked on both Firefox and Internet Explorer. Perhaps it has to do with our font size difference?

=== This is the page about blackberrys.... if you like to use the social networking fun then get this phone.... also good for email and web browsing.... also its got internet but i think android internet is slower than blackberry so it would be a good source to search the internet and download ringtones and wallpapers. you can store your files on the blackberry so if you need to look at them they have a file app in the folder called applications. well that is all i know about blackberries for now.... i have only had this phone for less than a month and still have to pay service for next month to find out any more.

I'm sorry, I should have called you ""Mr. Phelps"" from the start. To call you by your Christian first name was certainly uncivil. Now please, Mr. Phelps, tell us why you did it. Tell us why you did WTC. You receieved a testimony, didn't you? You either received a testimony or you just hate our freedom. Perhaps the testimony told you to hate our freedom.

The WP:Airlines is only a suggestion, it is not policy. Guess what outside of your flight sim community the average user of wiki does not care about destinations and my edit improves the article and still allows people interested in destinations to click the ""show"". WP:AIRLINES is not policy, it is a suggestion. Maybe you should care more about the introduction and history section of articles instead of the destination and fleet size (both of which are to minimal interest to the average public) 76.19.222.40  "

I appreciate your efforts but I have to ask, do we really care who plays him? He's a dog and sometimes an animatronic puppet. He's not in the opening credits so is it really necessary to list his name?  (✉) "

=== Warning templates on other's reverts 

Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.

Incidentally, I sometimes get edit conflicts on a perp's Talk page from an editor warning on a different instance of vandalism (sometimes even to the same page) some of them crank out the garbage edits at an amazing rate.  Anyway, sorry if it puzzled you.   | Talk

 Ain't bothering me, I'm not required to sign my posts/edit. I didn't specifically threaten anyone and your blowing it out of control. It was a snide comment. If I said ""I'm going to kill him in a fire"" thats different; saying ""I'm going to church to pray that he gets cancer or dies in a fire"" is more of a sarchastic tone. Pity you can't see that. No matter. Bump it up to 2 weeks now, just cause you can. "

Rense
Why is Tom Harrison posting articles from ""Rense"" as representative of the 9/11 truth movement researchers?  Rense is never linked to from the main 9/11 websites, never appears at conferences, never has done a book on 9/11 and promotes hoaxes that 99% of the 9/11 researchers have openly exposed, like the 'Jews Did It' claim that Tom keeps trying to smear everyone with -  Holocaust deniers push hoaxes that sabotage 9/11 Truth Movement, [www.911review.com/denial/holocaust.html Holocaust Denial Versus 9/11 Truth], etc.  Find one significant 9/11 site - not a UFO hoax site like Rense, which is obviously not a 9/11 site - that promotes the idea that Silverstein being Jewish had anything to do with his being focused on.  Go ahead and show me.  No significant site would ever promote this because we are not anti-semites, as much as it is Tom's goal to smear this group of activists with UFO and anti-semitic writings.  He's posted Rense around before but it does not represent the movement.   "

=== This is not a treasure hunt nor a mystery. The information is located in the back of the Technocracy Study Course. http://technocracy-incorporated.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Technocracy%2520study%2520guide.pdf
Technocracy%20study%20guide.pdf (application/pdf Object) That information was boiled down and presented there. It is that simple. Why turn this into a mysterious adventure when it is not ?
The pertinent information is there. That is the energy survey. It is the relevant facts regarding the resource base of North America. North America contains about 52 % of the worlds resource base. That was the figure when the Study Course was published. That figure is now higher due to the use of the rest of the world of their limited resource base. ( )

Since none of YOU boobs will do anything about it (despite being informed repeatedly), I had to take manners into my own hands.  Sue me if you don't like it, Dorothy.

=== Captions tell the history of an aircraft - if you are going to have a picture of an aircraft then you need to tell its story and background - this is only common sense if not for readability then for accuracy in reference. If you were to google F-16 this article is one of the first to be found so this make accuracy and completeness essential in these article (and it does not add too much more in size).  If wikipedia was a dictionary then a simple caption would be ok but tbut wikipedia is more then it is becoming a valuable reference tool as such accuracy and details is essential

Derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor. The statement is not about content I've added to this entry- of which there isn't any to speak of. (I could have opinions and theories about his mother but I don't go around posting them).  Instead User:scray choose to post the following message and block me.  ""I don't see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources."" This is equally as offensive as were the comments of the other editors- nor is the statement even true. You don't see much evidence because my properly sourced submissions are reverted. I ask you or any other editor to show me one misuse of a source. This is a a link to my last edit on the entry. diff  I include it as it was correctly sourced using per-approved sources that had consensus and the changes concerning definitions in the entry were discussed on the talk page and also had consensus..
Disruptive edit, not an improvement? That opinion is not supportable.

The changes were made to bring the entry into compliance with WP:lead standards because the definitions were faulty. .

Now I ask you (again #2), what content have I submitted on that page that had an unreliable source as you've alleged when blocking me? You have made the same unfounded accusation as the other two editors.  Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, keep that to your self! If you post a derogatory comment about me and can't back up the statement, you are lying too apparently simply in an attempt to damage my credibility. It is that simple. Now I formally ask you to Point out the reference are referring to in your negative posts about me!  This is not a difference of opinion.  It is a fabrication and a personal attack upon my credibility.  Comment on content, not on the contributor. You commented on both! and were not truthful in your comment about the content and sources.  Derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor.  Instead, you added more of them.

In addition, for like the fourth time, this person decides to call me ""a full blown believer and pusher of this conspiracy theory"" which I repeatedly denied.  I took offense.
Both other editors received talk messages from me. After you came along, One editor user: Dbrodbeck apologized for his statement..  I appreciate that and accept his apology and will tell him so when unblocked.  The other person user:Brangifer received a call for truce on his talk page but refused to retract his comment.  He has repeated attacked my credibility and now has thrown out a serious accusation without one shred of foundation or substance and banned me from his talk page.  His badgering continues on the entry talk page without apology or any shred of anything to substantiate his offensive comment. 

To have User:scray come along and say stuff like "" Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, name-calling (a personal attack) won't go well.""  I did not call a name. I called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that I was calling it as it presented itself. I did not comment on his edits, I commented the fact that he did not consider my reference to  articles from the Washington post, San Francisco Chronicle, Associated press, and National archives of the Government of Canada to be reliable sources.  Unbelievably, you seem be echoing his position.  I probably won't post this elsewhere but if you can't show me an example of using a poor source on that page, it is obvious that you have also posted the same fabrication about me in reference to sources. Anyone who fabricates or perpetuates or posts derogatory information is a liar. Liars cannot be trusted and lying editors compromise the integrity of WP.  user:Scray said ""I don't see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources.""  User:scray needs to show me where evidence was seen by him that had I based something in the entry on an unreliable source (#3).  User:scray  can not substantiate the posted comment the made. If you don't prove it with an example, then your statement is a lie. If you find yourself in this situation, then you are a liar and you have personally attacked this editors credibility. If that is the case, I'd

=== You reverted me and gave a reason when I called it external links, I reverted you and gave a reason again. I don't see the dispute. Now, if you read verifiability, self published sources are reliable published sources:
 At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.

So if the person who wrote this can be found to be an acknowledged expert in a relevent feild, then it can be a reference. If he has not, then it can not. Simple?

=== Welcome!

Welcome to Wikipedia, !  My name is Ryan, aka . I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use HTML and CSS. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.
Sincerely, . 10:01, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

=== Stop pushing POV here. Only The Hindu speculated (without source) 250 crore as revenue. Remember Enthiran is the biggest grosser in Tamil, not Dasa. Taran Adarsh estimated Enthiran's gross at 255.5 crore. So, Dasa must be lower than that.

=== Exercise reports 

Your call for consensus is foolish and short sighted. The idea of drawing conclusions from exercises is very much flawed for all the reasons given ad nauseum. Consensus cannot change facts. Wikipedia is not taken very seriously as it is. Why add ammunition?

Georgie cannot keep such a large block (virtually all of the east coast on Verizon's network blocked forever. Once the blocks are removed there will be a revision and edit war all over again.

You are currently engaged in a revert war over a link that you have not made a single arguement on the talk page to justify or remove. WP:EL does not require the link to contain information not in any other Wikipedia article, but to contain information relevant to the current article that could not be covered in it once it reaches Featured Article status, which CR does. CR provides a more detailed timeline then can ever be provided inside the article, and further that is shown simpyl by the existence of a timeline article. If the information in CR could be included in the article, we would not have a split off article obviously. So I ask you to participate on the talk page and use Wikipedia guidelines and policies to make your arguement as it would be more pursuasive then simply reverting without explanation based on more then personal opinion and feelings. Thank you.

As far as I know it has been stated that several ""universes"" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those ""universes"" or ""worlds"" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not ""accepted"" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

So far nobody's reverted me so that gives me hope. Meantime, let me pick your brain on a broader related issue. In recent years, Wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a ""vetting"" tool for employers, clients and others considering doing business with someone. Naturally, the one doing the vetting has the lion's share of responsibility in judging an entry's reliability and supplementing it with other research. That said, do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents, as far as possible, an accurate, well-rounded picture of the subject? In the case of Ms. Caesar, I was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and/or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny. What are your thoughts?   "

It is simply because s/he has taken the time to register for an account? I mean, is that really fair? Until the other user states his/her side, can't we just leave it locked  or WITHOUT the offending content? It makes me so irate that I have to keep coming back to this page defending my thoughts. Can't you take a (neutral) side and decide for yourself what needs to be done, anyway?

=== Also, another thing I'm not sure about, but anyone with a stronger knowledge on the group can affirm it. Based on their debut's album cover and photos of the group, it looks as if they were initially a quartet. Can anyone with the first album find who this fourth member was?

=== Olše was not invented by Czech nationalists. It was invented by Polish teachers from Galicia who came to teach on the newly established Polish high school in Teschen (established in 1895) and thought Olza is not Polish enough. (Other names suggested by these teachers were Olszawa (Olšava in old Czech maps), etc.) I really start to get annoyed by the nationalistic rubbish you keep on inserting here, Darwinek!

=== "
The First Division is included, but only for years when it was the top tier of English football. The top tier is the only relevant level. If you want to include Second Division titles, you're really only acknowledging that one club was in the Second Division longer than the other, and that's not anything worth shouting about. And would you please stop talking about ""major"" trophies. They're just trophies, there's nothing major or minor about them. – Jay "

=== " cannot decipher, and punitive actions.  As to the other complaints against me, I obtained a user name about the time I was being blocked for 24 hours for multiple reverts.  This block was supposedly sent to a talk page that I never registered (my IPA talk page) and would not use if I could help it: I would prefer not to broadcast my IPA.  Later, when I autosigned (which left my IPA behind as a signature), I believed I was logged on as Dylan Hunt, and certainly not trying to ""hide"" behind an IPA.   Common sense should suggest that no one would ""hide"" behind an IPA since these are more public than a user name."

 musings 

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!

i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  

""mere editors"" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.

a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like ""disruption"" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the ""trust admins to do what is right"".   it has failed.

Fair use rationale for Image:A_to_Z_(Butterfinger).jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:A_to_Z_(Butterfinger).jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ""my contributions"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ""Image"" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. –  "

=== ", and use the confusing, redundent, yet common phrase ""North America*""... *not refering to the continent. 

Either of two reasons:
A desire to place the United States last on the list, by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the ""fair"" use of alphabetization to make the US hard to find.
Simply an oversight.  

Well, nobody replied so I renamed the section on Territories and regions to U.N. subregions. It's amazing that this list puts the United States last, even though it has most of the people and 1/3 of the area. Is someone trying to ""de-emphasize"" America's importance?  

No it's just in alphabetical order.  

 Talk about... 

Any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively Canada and the United States??  

Yes: in the 'Human geography' section, namely the 3rd paragraph.  Other related terms are also treated in that sxn.   | talk | 

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can ""undeclare himself"". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. ""North America"" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think ""North American"" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast

Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also ""the"" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German ""von"" or ""zu"" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph's title as Fürst, which wouldn't make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04"

=== True, I've been off-topic. But I insist that, by logic, protestors who perceive China as a dictatorship is not the equlivalent, or represent, anti-dictatorial protestors (I've never even heard of such a thing - sounds more like political framing). Would those who protest the perceived dictatorship in Saudi Arabia go on to protest against China? Rarely. Anti-dictatorial is not a single classification - it should not even be a classification, in my opinion. I would suggest a more lengthy wording - e.g. supporters who call for more individual freedom in China.

=== If the phenomenon is bad, then what caused the phenomenon is also bad. I.e if murder is bad, so is the murderer. Nobody I've ever heard from said that the stagflation of the 70's was good and the stagflation of the 70's was mostl;y caused be federal Reserve policies.

Deflation is much maligned by Federal Reserve through its control of th economic profession. The US did much better economically in the 1800's under deflation then after 1913 and the Feds inflation. The reason that the Fed pushes inflation is that it provides a shelter from criticism of its theft of property through the wealth transfer effect of inflation. The one doing the money printing (inflating) will always defend the process because it makes him rich.71.174.141.4

 Why is the lingo/doublespeak/racist word ""contractors"" used instead of the precise English word ""mercenaries"" 

This is an encyclopedia not a press release.

Wikipedia is not supposed to be the house organ of any one government, but this article uses a lingo/doublespeak/racist term that the USA uses to describe mercenaries of any country other than a predominantly Caucasian political ally.

Wikipedia should be filtering out spin words an translating them into proper English.

I suggest that ""contractor"" only be used for unarmed non-military non-police contractors.

This simple rule should apply:  If the term ""mercenary"" would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an African government, the term ""mercenary"" should be used to describe the job or person working for a non-African government.

End the racism.  Speak in plain English.  This is an encyclopedia not a press release.

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) ""

As for ""The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are ""A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"" and ""An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read ""The algorithm used for this purpose..."" to ""One algorithm used for this purpose..."" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be ""...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for ""...references not supporting the notability of the subject"" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like ""Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for ""The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w

A slight difference with you
I have to disagree with your comment above that some of Bbb23's actions ""border on censorship."" No, some of his actions epitomize censorship and although I am generally quite reluctant to call for administrative procedures against anyone, and am not at all knowledgeable about such procedures, I think we need to get the ball rolling in this case. As my late Dad would have said ""the guy's an utter bird."" Nobody editing on Wikipedia should have to deal with this Little Napoleon nonsense.  "

Nonsense.  The truth is NO schools give sufficient information about Anthroposophy on their websites.  But I'll challenge you to find some that do.  Not links to information - but actual information on the website.  I could easily take out the ""some"" and make the sentence a lot less weasly.  "
